 * accepts for one message, so the turn failed before it started. Instead the
 * manifest is planned against a character budget: tools that fit are listed in
 * full, and the rest appear as a one-line catalog entry (name + summary). The
 * assistant navigates that catalog by requesting `buddy_tool_details` for the
 * names it intends to use, which returns those tools' full description and exact
 * args schema for the next turn.
 *
 * The details tool is handled by the chat provider itself (not the capability
 * registry) so it can describe VS Code editor tools as well as Buddy tools —
 * both reach the backend only through this manifest.
