This is a priming operation for comprehensive project analysis. You should only read and analyze - do not execute any actual operations or commands. Begin by reading @README.md, @webpack.config.cjs, @tsconfig.json, @package.json, and any @.eslintrc* or @prettier.config* files to understand project scope, dependencies, build configuration, and code formatting standards. Review the output of `git ls-files`, `eza --git-ignore --tree`, and `find . -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.jsx" | head -20` to map project structure, file organization, version control context, and identify key source files. Strictly adhere to all coding standards, architectural patterns, type definitions, and implementation guidelines specified in @.claude/ts-guide.md, @/ts-guide, @/CONTRIBUTING.md, or similar documentation files. Analyze existing code patterns by examining 2-3 representative files from @/src to understand naming conventions, import/export patterns, error handling approaches, and component/function structure. Prioritize efficiency by leveraging shared utilities from @/src/utils, existing type definitions, established helper functions, and consistent architectural patterns while maintaining strict compatibility with the existing codebase's TypeScript configuration, linting rules, and established conventions for optimal code generation and modifications.
