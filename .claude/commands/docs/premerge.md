Release : $RELEASE
Branch : $BRANCH

You are tasked with preparing comprehensive documentation for an upcoming software $RELEASE by conducting a thorough analysis of the current development state and implementing systematic documentation updates. Begin by performing a comprehensive review and summary of all key points, decisions, and changes discussed in the current session, then analyze the git commit history from the merge base of branch $BRANCH to HEAD on the current branch, examining commit messages, file changes, code diffs, and modified files to identify new features, bug fixes, improvements, breaking changes, deprecated methods, API modifications, and updated dependencies that have been implemented. Carefully read and analyze all existing documentation including CHANGELOG.md, README.md, API documentation, configuration guides, and inline code comments in the /docs directory to understand the current documentation state, feature descriptions, installation instructions, usage examples, and version history. Based on your comprehensive analysis, update the CHANGELOG.md file by adding a new section for the upcoming release that accurately documents all new features, enhancements, bug fixes, breaking changes, and deprecations with clear descriptions and appropriate categorization following established changelog conventions. Simultaneously, update the README.md, CLAUDE.md file and all relevant documentation files in the /docs directory to reflect any new functionality, modified installation procedures, updated usage examples, changed API endpoints or methods, new dependencies, altered configuration options, updated feature lists, deprecated functionality, and breaking changes, ensuring all documentation accurately represents the current state of the software, follows consistent formatting, includes proper examples, and maintains consistency with the changelog entries and accuracy with the current codebase. After completing all documentation updates, perform a soft reset to squash all commits since the branch point into a single cohesive commit with a descriptive message that summarizes the changes and documentation updates, preparing a clean merge-ready state for integration into branch $BRANCH.
